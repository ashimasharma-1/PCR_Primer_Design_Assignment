Primer Specificity Verification

Primer Pair 3 was analyzed using Primer-BLAST against the Homo sapiens genome (taxid: 9606).

Results:
- Only one predicted PCR product was obtained.
- No significant off-target binding was observed.
- No amplification of pseudogenes or non-target loci was detected.

Conclusion:
The selected primer pair shows high specificity and is suitable for PCR amplification in human samples.
